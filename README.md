# RNG bot
The bot was build for hack 16, a floor event for the drexel CCI LLC. 
The goal of the project was to create a discord bot that could take input about the quality of the food at the eateries and return an average for the day
The current functionality is that you can input data and get an average. You can also storage data to a cvs file.
